Today i made my journal
i hate the phone law because i love using my phone in it helps me with school work in to learn better .what i think about the cell phone law i think its so strict towards children in alot of kids cant focus without phones. experience is when i go to school every day i got to put my phone away .And also some kids need it to call there perents . And im not really adjusting good to the phone law .in if we were going into lock down we wouldnt have no one to call .And i think they need to take the phone law down .
